## ✨ Features

- **🎲 Random Problem Selection**: 3 random coding problems on each visit
- **🌙 Dark Theme**: Beautiful dark purple gradient with cyan accents
- **👁️ Solution Toggle**: Hide/show solutions with smooth animations
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **⚡ Fast Loading**: Optimized for GitHub Pages with embedded fallback content

## 🛠️ How It Works

### GitHub Pages Compatibility
- **Static Site**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no build process required
- **Fallback System**: Uses embedded sample problems for reliable GitHub Pages deployment
- **CDN Assets**: Prism.js loaded from reliable CDN for syntax highlighting
- **No Jekyll**: `.nojekyll` file ensures static file serving

### Architecture
- `index.html` - Main page structure
- `styles.css` - Dark theme and responsive design
- `script.js` - Problem management and interactivity
- `.nojekyll` - Bypasses Jekyll processing
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` - Automatic deployment workflow

## 🎮 User Experience

1. **Landing**: Users see 3 random coding problems immediately
2. **Interaction**: Clean toggle buttons to reveal/hide solutions
3. **Refresh**: "Get New Problems" button for fresh challenges
4. **Responsive**: Smooth experience on all devices

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- Embedded problem data for instant loading
- Minimal external dependencies
- Optimized CSS with smooth animations
- Efficient JavaScript with fallback systems

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement approach

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Check if GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
2. Ensure the deployment workflow has permissions
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

### If problems don't appear:
- The site uses embedded sample problems by default
- No external API calls required
- Works offline and on any static hosting

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to modify:
- `styles.css` - Change colors, fonts, or layout
- `script.js` - Add more sample problems or modify behavior
